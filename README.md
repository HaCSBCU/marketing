#Welcome to HaCS Marketing

This is the Marketing Material repo. Here you will find all related material to marketing under the
Birmingham City University Hackathon and Computing Society.

##Directory Structure
The abstract top level directory structure for HaCS is as follows:

```
| Clothing
| Email
| Global Assets
| HaCS Logo
| Other Society Logos
| Social
```
Here is a summery of each directory.

###Clothing
All assets regarding the HaCS clothing should be stored in here. This includes T-Shirts and hoodies.

###Email
This is where we store the assets used in the mainchimp emails. Any assets that are reguarly used in the emails should be stored in this directory. **NOTE:** event headers should not be stored in this directory. They are primarily used in social media so should be stored in the *social* folder.

###Global assets
This folder should be used as a place to store uncategorized assets. For example, hackathon photos, event photos, anything that could be used at a later date. Think of it as a central spot to find cool content to use in social and branding material.

###HaCS Logo
All logo files are stored in this directory. You **shouldn't** have to tamper with any of the AI or PSD files. All variations and filetypes of logos can be found in the ```Logo Exports``` folder inside this directory.

###Other society Logos
Fairly self explanatory - place all other society logos in this section.

###Social
All social media header and content should be placed here. As you can see, there are three sub-folders: ```Facebook Events```, ```Facebook Posts``` and ```Social Assets```.

####Facebook Events
All event headers should be inside this folder. As you can see, we created a new folder every month to keep things in a well ordered fashion.

##Advice
All templates in this repository are in either Photoshop or Illustrator format. We strongly recommend using the Adobe tools in order to carry out your abilities as a marketing officer. You can get a student discount on the Adobe Suite or find a way to pirate it. This is our advice to you - however there is nothing stopping you finding a free alternative, but if you do, we expect the templates already created to be recreated and to the same standard.

##Support
If you require any support in understanding how everything works, or if you need help designing assets, I am free to contact and help. Either reach out to me on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/alexwileyy) or [Email me](mailto:alex@alexwiley.co.uk)

That's all. Hope you find it easy enough to get started!
